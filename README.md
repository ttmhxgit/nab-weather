# **Getting Started**

**This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).**

- Clone the branch in the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:ttmhxgit/nab-weather.git
```

- Use [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/) version v14.17.2 or upper

```
node -v
```

- Use package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) version 1.22.10 or upper

```
yarn -v  
```

**Set local enviroment**
- Create ```.env``` file in the root directory of the project. Add the following properties in it:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5
REACT_APP_API_KEY = 8558922033368b54985fb6ea5d1b0d3a
REACT_APP_ICON_URL = https://openweathermap.org/img/w
```

# **Script**
In the project directory, you can run:

```
yarn run start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```
yarn run test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

```
yarn run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode.

```
yarn run eject
```
It will stop hiding what it's got installed under the hood and instead eject those things into your project's package.json for everyone to see.
